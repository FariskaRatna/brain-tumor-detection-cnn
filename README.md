# CNN Brain Tumor Detection
## **Overview**
Brain tumor is a disease characterized by abnormal cell growth in brain tissue. One of the ways that doctors can detect brain tumors is direct observation with manual diagnosis which has a risk of error. The development of artificial intelligence on computer vision has now been applied in image classification in the health sector. Based on this case, we are building a classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks to address the disease problem.
